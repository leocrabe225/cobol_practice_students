# Cobol Practice Student
This COBOL project is an exercise to practice reading, storing, and writing sequential files.
The goal is to : 
- Read a file, which contains a record for each student and another record for each of his grade in every course.
- Store the content of that file in a structured way.
- Process the data to calculate the average per student, per course, and the class average.
- Write the newly obtained data in a properly formatted way to an output file.

Some attention was put towards input verification, such as UTF-8 characters, duplicate, or missing data.
